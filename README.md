A guide to a raspberry pi shuffler for tv shows

About a year ago i was looking for cool raspberry pi projects to do. I stumbled across one that i immediately new 
I needed to build. The Simpsons Shuffler by Stephen Coyle. After hours of building and making the code he provided work for 
me and my needs (and a little help from Stephen himself) I had a pi zero that shuffles episodes of the simpsons on button push and ALSO safely turned off on a long button press. I posted my project to reddit and have been recieving requests for help
ever since. So i have decided to finally make my own guide to take begginers step by step through the process. 

This is a work in progress and all feedback is welcome!
